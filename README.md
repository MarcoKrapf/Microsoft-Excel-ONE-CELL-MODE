# Microsoft Excel ONE CELL MODE
[Excel-Add-In (.xlam)](http://marco-krapf.de/excel/) which makes absolutely no sense

This Add-in activates the MICROSOFT EXCEL ONE CELL MODE (also called FLEUERER MODE or ABSOLUTE BEGINNER MODE). The current worksheet will be cleared. All cells will be merged. There will be only one cell left (A1). There is absolutely no need to do this. Simply stupid.
